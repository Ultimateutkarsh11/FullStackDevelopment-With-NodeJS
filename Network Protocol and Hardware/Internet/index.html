                <p class="text-center m-2 p-1">
                    A modulator-demodulator or modem is a computer hardware device that converts data from a digital format into a format suitable for an analog transmission medium such as telephone or radio. A modem transmits data by modulating one or more carrier wave signals to encode digital information, while the receiver demodulates the signal to recreate the original digital information. The goal is to produce a signal that can be transmitted easily and decoded reliably. Modems can be used with almost any means of transmitting analog signals, from light-emitting diodes to radio.

                <p class="text-center m-2 p-1">
                   <b>Client:</b>  When we talk the word Client, it mean to talk of a person or an organization using a particular service. Similarly in the digital world a Client is a computer (Host) i.e. capable of receiving information or using a particular service from the service providers (Servers).
                </p>
                <p class="text-center m-2 p-1">
                   <b>Servers:</b>  Similarly, when we talk the word Servers, It mean a person or medium that serves something. Similarly in this digital world a Server is a remote computer which provides information (data) or access to particular services.
                </p>
                <p class="text-center m-2 p-1"><b>So, its basically the Client requesting something and the Server serving it as long as its present in the database.</b></p>

                <p class="text-center m-2 p-1">
                    A domain name is a string that identifies a realm of administrative autonomy, authority or control within the Internet. Domain names are often used to identify services provided through the Internet, such as websites, email services and more. As of 2017, 330.6 million domain names had been registered.[1] Domain names are used in various networking contexts and for application-specific naming and addressing purposes. In general, a domain name identifies a network domain or an Internet Protocol (IP) resource, such as a personal computer used to access the Internet, or a server computer.

                    What Is a Ping Test?
                </h3>
                <p class="text-center m-2 p-1">Ping is a networking utility program or a tool to test if a particular host is reachable. It is a diagnostic that checks if your computer is connected to a server. Ping, a term taken from the echo location of a submarine, sends data packet to a server and if it receives a data packet back, then you have a connection. The term "ping" can refer to the time it takes for a data packet to travel round-trip. It means "get the attention of" or "check the presence of". In a computer network, a ping test is a way of sending messages from a computer to another. Aside from checking if the computer is connected to a network, ping also gives indicators of the reliability and general speed of the connection.</p>

                <p class="text-center m-2 p-1"><b>No</b>.We are having ping time compareable to the light of speed.. if we want to reduce the ping time then we need the direct connection from source to destination not any other nodes in between</p>

                    Define Protocol?
                </h3>
                <p class="text-center m-2 p-1">a protocol is a set of rules for formatting and processing data. Network protocols are like a common language for computers. The computers within a network may use vastly different software and hardware; however, the use of protocols enables them to communicate with each other regardless.</p>
