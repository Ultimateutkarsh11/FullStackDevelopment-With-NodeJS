    <!-- alt is used when either internet is not working or a website is being used by blind person then browser will read the text written inside the alt tag -->
    <!-- IMP by default image come by the original height and width of the image you can use height and width to manage it -->
    <!-- IMP img is inline in nature -->

    <!-- by default video does not have controls you need to provide them so just write controls inside the video tag -->
    <!-- video is also inline and you just need to set either height or width other thing is set automatically -->
    <!-- when you want that your video should play as the web page opens then you can use autoplay ,it is not guarnted as some browser block the autoplay feature -->
    <!-- you can set loop so that it plays again as it finishes off once -->
    <!-- <video loop autoplay height="250" controls src="./HTML/media/big_buck_bunny_720p_20mb.mp4"></video> -->
    <!-- you can use preload to explain further features of the video  -->
    <!-- if you set preload ="none then it will not provide any info to screen untill user clicks it i.e it does not load the meta data" -->
    <!-- if preload="auto" it is just like normal ,it starts the downloading of the video even if user is not clicking at it -->
    <!-- if preload is metadata then it just load the thumbnail and auration of the video on the screen nothing else-->
