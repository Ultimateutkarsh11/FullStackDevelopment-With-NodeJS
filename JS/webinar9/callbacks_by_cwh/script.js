//sycronous programing is the execution in a sequence

// let a=prompt("What is you name?");
// let b=prompt("what is your age?");
// let c=prompt("what is your favorite color?");
// console.log(a+ " is " +b+" years old and has "+c+" favorite color.");

// Asynchronous programing occurs when some code is executing parrally without blocking the further execution of the code 
// Asynchoronous programming can be achieved by the callbacks and promises
// Promises are better option because it ignores the callback hell or right alinment of the code
// Promises are more reliable
